<h3>Привет, мир!</h3>
<p>
    Welcome to the world of football history! Have you ever wondered what it would be like to play with the very first teams to grace the beautiful game?
    Well, wonder no more! The website you're in is here to offer you an immersive experience into the history of football, and all you need is an internet connection!
</p>
<p>
    In October 2013, a passionate Italian gamer of the FIFA series and a football history enthusiast began making a patch for FIFA 14 that would transport us 
    to the past. Two other Italians later joined him, and their product has been maintained for almost 10 years.
</p>
<p>
    We are proud to present to you the FIFA 14 'History Of Football' patch, which brings together a complete collection of teams from as far back as the 1870s.
    This patch was carefully crafted to ensure accuracy, data completion, and proper design, making it the perfect addition to your FIFA 14 gaming
    experience. You can now take on the role of legendary football pioneers and compete in matches that helped shape the game we all love today.
</p>
<p>
    But that's not all! The website (which has been made by a fan of the patch) offers a unique experience for those who love football history but may not 
    necessarily enjoy video games. We have meticulously documented every team, player, and match to give you a glimpse into the evolution of football. You 
    can browse through the history of football at your own pace, discovering interesting facts and learning about the pioneers who helped shape the sport 
    we all love.
</p>
<p>
    Please note: The patch has two versions - one for FIFA 14 and one for FIFA 16. The FIFA 14 version is primary, while the other one is copied from the 
    main version from time to time. Currently, only the FIFA 14 version is supported on the site.
</p>
<p>
    We have also included visual representations for some additional add-ons created by other fans: the '2010s addon' by Jbou41 and the '21st century addon' 
    by Valambrosio. These add-ons were not included in the 'canon' and are maintained separately, but can be installed over the main content.
</p>
<p>
    Enjoy your exploration of football history on our website. We hope you have a fantastic experience and gain a deeper appreciation for the game's rich
    and fascinating past. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to <a href="https://localhost:44336/Home/Contacts">reach out</a> to us.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you for visiting our site!
